Final Project Plan

## Elevator Pitch
I will making a wiki app for people who want to explore the Star Wars universe. The app serves as a darabase for the most famous Star Wars characters. On top of a list of common features of a said character, the app should also direct users to which movies the charaters were featured in. Once directed to the movies, the users can then browse the list of charaters featured in say movie. The intended audience for this app are those who would like to know more about a Star Wars charater they may have heard their friends talking about.
